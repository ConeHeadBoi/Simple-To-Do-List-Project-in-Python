# Simple-To-Do-List-Project-in-Python
Just a simple to do list that has been made in python that should be able to add, remove, and show that something has been done.

To be able to run it in vs code if you have the python enviroment then just run it normally if not just use the terminal to open it use the keys Ctrl + ` and it will open and then in the terminal type "python app.py" and it will run.

Now you will be in the main menu of the to do list and as shown input a number from 1 - 5 to use something in the to do list like add, remove, mark, display, or exit and each input does as it is said on the menu so pretty straight forward and simple to use.

It also goes in a loop forever after you have done something so that you the user can keep using it as much as you want the only way to exit from it is if you close vs code itself or by just iputting 5 at the menu to exit from the application.
